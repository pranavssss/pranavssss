## About Me

- I’m a Master’s student in Data Science at Rutgers University with hands-on experience in data analysis, machine learning, AI, and business intelligence. 
- I enjoy transforming raw data into actionable insights, building intelligent systems, and automating workflows.
- I spend a lot of time working with LLMs and machine learning systems — fine-tuning models, benchmarking performance, and building semantic and concept search pipelines.
- I’m passionate about leveraging data science to **automate the entire data science life cycle** using **agentic AI and predefined protocols**, and building **custom AI solutions**. 

- I’m someone who wants to *"build a lemonade stand out of lemons, not just work at the lemonade stand"*.
  
- Beyond tech, I love art 🎨, piano 🎹 , and playing badminton  🏸 .
